After years of learning to program and acquiring new technical skills, I finally pursued this. My first blog showing my portfolio.
I started the machine learning journey unconventionally. I had to learn to program, refresh my mathematics and statistics. I enrolled on to and completed many online courses. Combining all these, which has enabled me produce this final website and to reflect my skills and ongoing projects. 
## Basics first
Some say machine learning is glorified statistics and I do agree. Machine learning concepts were in practice for a long time and used in academics. Deep learning is a part of machine learning where we use the artificial neuronal network to come to the desired outcome.
I know you find these explanations in thousands of online resources and website, but as with everyone, I will explain this in short.

## A simple prediction model
Imagine you have to guess a number and your friends tells you if you are higher or lower than the expected number.  you randomly guess a number and keep adjusting the number so that you arrive at the final answer.
