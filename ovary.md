# Ovarian tumor prediction
## __

This is webdeoplyment of a my colleage Dr. Adel who is very good with abstract mathematics. He had developed an mathematical algorith which predicts a tumor type of ovaries 
based on the MRI imaging findings.
 
## Tools used
Python for calculations
Flask and Heroku to web deployment
HTML with CSS (I am not a webdeveloper, but this website is not bad)

## A simple prediction model
Imagine you have to guess a number and your friends tells you if you are higher or lower than the expected number.  you randomly guess a number and keep adjusting the number so that you arrive at the final answer.
