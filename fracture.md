## _Fracture detection with deep learning_

After years of learning to program and acquiring new technical skills, I finally made it into this. My first blog showing my portfolio.
I started the machine learning journey unconventionally. I had to learn to program, refresh my mathematics and statistics. I enrolled and completed many online courses. Combining all these, this final website is shaping to reflect my skills and ongoing projects. 

## Basics first

Some say machine learning is glorified statistics and I do agree. Machine learning concepts were in practice for a long time and used in academics. Deep learning is a part of machine learning where we use the artificial neuronal network to come to the desired outcome.
I know you find these explanations in thousands of online resources and website, but it is a ritual to refresh it again.

## A simple prediction model
Imagine you have to guess a number and your friends tells you if you are higher or lower than the expected number.  you randomly guess a number and keep adjusting the number so that you arrive at the final answer.

## Machine learning
In machine learning, the algorithm does the same with different equations or different approaches. One approach can be extrapolating the expected outcome or the other can be predicting the outcome similar to the surrounding cases (case with similar characteristics have a similar outcome).

## Deep learning:
Deep learning uses what's called layers of artificial neurons.
